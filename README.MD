# Actions Status Space

Post GitHub Actions status to Discord as an beautiful embed

- :sushi: **_Super Easy!_** Works perfectly out of the box.
- :sushi: **_OS & Arch-agnostic!_** Supports Linux (Ubuntu), macOS (Intel, M1) and Windows runners.
- :sushi: **_Fast!_** Faster than ones written as Docker container action.
